# Rooted

Stop Parish Shopping. Start Putting Down Roots.

Finding a reverent liturgy shouldn't feel like a gamble. You want a parish where the homilies challenge you, the music lifts you, and the reverence draws you in—not a place you have to "endure."

Rooted takes the guesswork out of Sunday morning. We crowd-source data on altar rails, confession availability, chant, and silence to give every parish a Reverence Score.

Why use Rooted?

The Reverence Meter: Instantly see how a parish scores on tradition and liturgical care (e.g., St. John Vianney: 92/100).

Filter by Detail: Looking for Latin? Ad Orientem? Communion on the tongue? Find it fast.

Settling Down: Stop driving 45 minutes to five different churches. Find the one where you can finally plant your family.
